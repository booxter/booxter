### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Systems Software Engineer in Networking. I contributed to several major
open source cloud and SDN projects, including
[OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/),
[KubeVirt](https://kubevirt.io/),
[Open vSwitch](https://www.openvswitch.org/)
(mostly [OVN](https://www.ovn.org/)).

Primary tools: Unix, C, Python, Go, some Shell.

Also: tmux, NeoVim, Obsidian, Nix. All things CLI.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the
[next](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-openstack-services-openshift-next-generation-red-hat-openstack-platform)
cloud native version of Red Hat OpenStack.

I'm also contributing to [Instruct Lab](https://instructlab.ai/), a LLM
training tool set.

ðŸŒ± These days, Iâ€™m exploring the world of declarative pure configuration using
[Nix](https://nixos.org/).
