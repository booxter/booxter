### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Systems Software Engineer in N**o**tworking.

I contributed to several major open source cloud and SDN projects, including
[OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/),
[KubeVirt](https://kubevirt.io/),
[Open vSwitch](https://www.openvswitch.org/) and [OVN](https://www.ovn.org/).

ðŸ”­ My latest major project was making the networking integration for the
[next](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-openstack-services-openshift-next-generation-red-hat-openstack-platform)
cloud native version of **Red Hat OpenStack** a success.

ðŸ§ª I have now moved to AI realm (haven't we all) and work closely with the
[**Instruct Lab**](https://instructlab.ai/) community.

ðŸŒ± These days, Iâ€™m exploring the world of declarative pure configuration using
[**Nix**](https://nixos.org/).

**Primary tools**: Unix, C, Python, Go, Shell, NeoVim, Nix.
