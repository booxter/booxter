### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Systems Software Engineer in Networking. I contributed to several major
open source cloud and SDN projects, including
[OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/),
[KubeVirt](https://kubevirt.io/),
[Open vSwitch](https://www.openvswitch.org/)
(mostly [OVN](https://www.ovn.org/)).

I'm interested in networking protocols. I prefer low level programming.

I scribble code in C, Python, Go. I can survive shell or ansible coding if I
have to. I know my way with NeoVim, Tmux, and Obsidian.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the
[next](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-openstack-services-openshift-next-generation-red-hat-openstack-platform)
cloud native version of Red Hat OpenStack.

ðŸŒ± These days, Iâ€™m slowly learning eBPF and playing with local LLMs.
